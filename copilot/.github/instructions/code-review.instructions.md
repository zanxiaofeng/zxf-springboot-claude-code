# Code Review Checklist

## Checklist
- [ ] JavaDoc on all public classes and methods
- [ ] Constructor injection (no @Autowired on fields)
- [ ] DTOs use record
- [ ] Service has interface + impl
- [ ] No business logic in Controller
- [ ] Test naming: `*IT` for integration, `*ContractTest` for contract
- [ ] Contract Test covers new endpoints
- [ ] Flyway migration for DB changes
- [ ] Error handling uses BusinessException
- [ ] Downstream client interface exists in domain layer (if calling external services)
- [ ] WireMock stubs present for downstream calls in integration tests

## Architecture Review
- [ ] Four-layer separation maintained (Domain -> Application -> Infrastructure -> Interfaces)
- [ ] Domain layer has no Spring/framework dependencies
- [ ] Repository is interface in domain, implementation in infrastructure
- [ ] Downstream client is interface in domain, implementation in infrastructure

## Refactoring Guide

### Pre-conditions
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%

### Steps
1. Identify code smells (duplication, long methods, unclear naming)
2. Write characterization tests if coverage is low
3. Apply refactoring incrementally
4. Run tests after each change
5. Update documentation if public API changed

### Safety Rules
- Never refactor without passing tests
- One refactoring at a time
- Prefer small commits
